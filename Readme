This is a repository used with the coursera course on tools for Data Scientists using Python and SQL
I have also added other interesting programs using Python and MYSQL
- script4.py - finds out in what country is the entered language spoked.  Uses MYSQL world sample database.
- zillowtest6.py - tallys views and saves over three months and prints monthly totals
- Zillow views-saves.csv - raw datafile used by zillowtest6.py
- Anagram.py - takes two strings as inout and sees if the letters all match ie: an anagram else print msg indicating not an anagram
